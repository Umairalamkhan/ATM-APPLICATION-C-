# ATM-APPLICATION-C-

This repository contains the backend code for an ATM Machine system designed to simulate basic ATM functionalities such as account balance checks, withdrawals, deposits, and transfers between accounts. Built using Python (or specify language used), the system allows users to authenticate using a PIN and interact with their bank accounts through a command-line interface. The program supports multiple accounts, transaction history logging, and withdrawal limits. To set up the project, simply clone the repository, install any required dependencies, and run the backend program to simulate ATM operations. Contributions to improve the system, whether through bug fixes, new features, or optimizations, are welcome. This project is licensed under the MIT License, and contributors are encouraged to fork the repository and submit pull requests. For detailed usage instructions,
