# ATM-APPLICATION-C-
This repository contains the backend code for an ATM Machine system built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The program simulates essential ATM functionalities such as account balance checks, deposits, withdrawals, and money transfers between multiple accounts. Users authenticate through a PIN, and the system allows interaction with their bank accounts via a console-based interface. The ATM system is designed using OOP techniques, organizing key features such as account management, transaction processing, and user authentication into distinct classes for improved modularity and maintainability. To set up and run the system, clone the repository, compile the C++ code, and execute the program to simulate ATM operations. Contributions to enhance the program with additional features, optimizations, or bug fixes are welcome.
